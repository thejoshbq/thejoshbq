## About Me

I’m a software developer with a knack for tackling diverse challenges—whether it’s writing Arduino sketches in C++, crafting Python packages, or designing browser-based UIs with frameworks like Voila and Panel. My projects range from custom libraries to experimental tools, and I’m always looking for new ways to push my skills. I have experience working in agile environments using the SCRUM methodology, which has helped me deliver projects efficiently and collaboratively. Right now, I’m deepening my knowledge in machine learning and data analysis, focusing on clustering, classification, and regression techniques.

## Technologies

- **Languages**: Python, C++, Java, HTML/CSS  
- **Frameworks**: Django, Flask, Pandas, NumPy, Tensorflow, Scikit-learn, PySerial, Panel, PySide6, Plotly
- **Tools**: Git, Arduino

## Projects

### REACHER Suite

I’m developing the ***Rodent Experiment Application Controls and Handling Ecosystem for Research (REACHER Suite)***, an open-source framework for experimental paradigms with head-fixed rodents. It connects to multiple microcontrollers and supports running simultaneous sessions, either on a single machine or across distributed systems.
