## 👨🏻‍💻 &nbsp;About Me

💡 I'm a software developer and data analyst for the [Otis Lab](https://www.otis-lab.org) at the Medical University of South Carolina.

💻 Current project(s):
  - [Pynapse](https://github.com/thejoshbq/pynapse) - a custom Python library for aligning 2-photon microscopy trace recordings with accompanying behavioral event logs and extracting neural data at event windows for analysis
  - [REACHER](https://github.com/Otis-Lab-MUSC/reacher) - an open-source Python-based framework for managing experiments with head-fixed rodents and data acquisition
  - [The Labrynth](https://github.com/Otis-Lab-MUSC/labrynth) - a deployable Panel-based frontend built using `REACHER`
  - [ChangeGenius](https://github.com/CSCI495-Modus21/change-genius) - a change-request management system with integrated LLM for expidited processes and database queries

✍️ Outside of code, I’m into: 
  - Hiking scenic trails  
  - Playing disc golf  
  - Traveling to new places  
  - Finding the best local coffee spots

💬 Unapologetically, pineapple belongs on pizza and the only *correct* way to drink coffee is black.
