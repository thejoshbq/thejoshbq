# 👋 Hi, I'm Joshua Boquiren  

Welcome to my GitHub! I'm a versatile "Swiss Army Knife" style software developer with a strong foundation in neuroscience research and embedded systems. My work spans across Python, C++ (Arduino), RESTful API development, data analysis, and interactive dashboard creation. I take pride in optimizing workflows, refining existing systems, and designing robust software solutions that integrate hardware and software seamlessly.

## 🧠 Neuroscience & Experimental Paradigm Development  

I currently work at the **Medical University of South Carolina (MUSC)** in the **Otis Lab**, where our research focuses on pathways connected to **drug-seeking behavior**. Since joining, I have:  

- 🔬 **Refracted and optimized** data analysis pipelines  
- 🎛 **Developed the REACHER Suite**—a system that integrates an **Arduino framework** with a **Python-based GUI** for running behavioral paradigms on **head-fixed rodents**  
- 🚀 Enhanced experimental paradigms to improve **efficiency, flexibility, and scalability**
